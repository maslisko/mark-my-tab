# Mark My Tab

A small Firefox extension for marking tabs with one of prefefined icons.

## Running

Taken from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#trying_it_out):

Open the `about:debugging` page, click the `This Firefox` option, click the `Load Temporary Add-on` button, then select any file in your extension's directory.

The extension now installs, and remains installed until you restart Firefox.

Alternatively, you can run the extension from the command line using the web-ext tool.
