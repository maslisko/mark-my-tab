# Flag The Tab

A small Firefox extension for flagging tabs which you want to revisit in a near future.

Sometimes you need just something very, very simple. No new panels, no configuration, just a click away.

## Running

Taken from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#trying_it_out):

Open the `about:debugging` page, click the `This Firefox` option, click the `Load Temporary Add-on` button, then select any file in your extension's directory.

The extension now installs, and remains installed until you restart Firefox.

Alternatively, you can run the extension from the command line using the web-ext tool.
